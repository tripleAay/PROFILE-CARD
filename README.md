## Task Requirements

In this project, I created a **responsive Profile Card** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. The Profile Card displays several elements about me, and each element is styled to be visually appealing and responsive.

### Required Elements

Each required element includes a `data-testid` attribute for easy testing. Here are the elements that make up the profile card:

1. **Profile Picture**  
   - A profile picture is displayed with the attribute:  
   `data-testid="profilePicture"`  
   - The image is made responsive by adjusting either the width or height while maintaining the aspect ratio.

2. **Full Name**  
   - Your full name is displayed with the attribute:  
   `data-testid="fullName"`

3. **Job Title**  
   - The job title (either your current job title or desired job title) is displayed with the attribute:  
   `data-testid="jobTitle"`

4. **Short Bio**  
   - A short bio about yourself (50-100 words) is included with the attribute:  
   `data-testid="shortBio"`

5. **Current Location**  
   - Your current city and country are displayed with the attribute:  
   `data-testid="currentLocation"`

6. **Email Address**  
   - A professional email address is added with the attribute:  
   `data-testid="emailAddress"`

7. **Social Links**  
   - Links to your professional social profiles (e.g., LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter) are included with the attribute:  
   `data-testid="socialLinks"`

8. **Current Time in UTC**  
   - The current time in **UTC** format is displayed with the attribute:  
   `data-testid="currentTimeUTC"`
